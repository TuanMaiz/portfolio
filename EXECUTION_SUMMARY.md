  - Date formatting (relative and absolute)
  - Text processing (truncation, excerpt extraction)
  - Slug generation
  - Email validation
  - UI helpers (colors, initials, etc.)
- ✅ **Type Definitions** for all data models
- ✅ **Error Handling** with proper HTTP status codes

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ **API Documentation** endpoint (`/api`)
- ✅ **Comprehensive README** with:
  - Setup instructions
