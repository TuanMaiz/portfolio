# Portfolio Layout Guideline (Inspired by mattdeitke.com)

## 1. Theme & Style
- **Color palette**: Monochrome, but **softened** — avoid pure black `#000` and pure white `#fff`.
  - Use off-white (e.g., `#f8f8f8`) for background.
  - Use dark gray (e.g., `#1a1a1a` or `#222`) for text instead of pure black.
- Minimalist typography with generous spacing.
- No heavy gradients or flashy animations — focus on clarity and hierarchy.
- Use subtle hover states for links (e.g., underline on hover).
- Use TailwindCSS and typescript

---

## 2. Hero Section
- Full-width, top-of-page.
- Includes:
  - **Name** prominently displayed.
  - **Title/role** (e.g., “AI Researcher at Meta Superintelligence Lab”).
  - Short **self-intro** in 1–2 lines.
- Center-aligned or left-aligned depending on viewport width.

---

## 3. Contact & Location Info
- Placed just below the intro.
- Includes:
  - Professional **email**.
  - **Location**.
- Styled as plain text — no heavy icons or borders.

---

## 4. News / Highlights Section
- Chronological list of updates (new projects, awards, talks).
- Each entry:
  - **Date** (month/year).
  - **Title** or event.
  - Optional small **image** or badge.
- Keep consistent spacing between items.

---

## 5. Publications / Projects Section
- Structured as headings with grouped items.
- Each item:
  - **Title**.
  - Short **description**.
  - Links to **paper**, **demo**, or **code**.
- Avoid overly large images — keep text focus.

---

## 6. Structure & Navigation
- **Responsive design** — works on mobile and desktop.
- Optional top navigation with anchor links to sections (`#news`, `#publications`, etc.).
- Keep scrolling experience smooth and readable.

---

## 7. Optional Add-ons
- Link to **CV** (PDF) in top section or footer.
- Social media links (GitHub, X/Twitter, LinkedIn) in a subtle style.
